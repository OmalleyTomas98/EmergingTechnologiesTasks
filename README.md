## Deployment 
- To run my program(s) you must carefully follow the instructions provided in the links below to successfully run .
 1. git clone https://github.com/OmalleyTomas98/EmergingTechnologiesTasks.git
 2. cd EmergingTechnologiesTasks
 3. jupyter notebook 
 4. navigate through the file system e.g Task1 
 5. click run to execute the python Script
 


- Underneath is a list of all the software needed and installed to develop my program  for the Module : Emerging Technologies 



* [Windows 10  Installation   ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10) 
  - Windows 10 is the Operating System used to Develope my Programs.
* [Anaconda Installation   ](https://www.anaconda.com/) 
  - Anaconda is a package tool that install Python(3.8) used largely by Data Scientists.

* [Docker Installation](https://www.docker.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=dockerhomepage&utm_content=nemea&utm_term=dockerhomepage&utm_budget=growth&gclid=Cj0KCQiA8dH-BRD_ARIsAC24umarjP9XjIo_qI0gCJSfvesHjGmRdcFrk3JSXOKtQsHPbueLkN-IHmEaAphBEALw_wcB)
  - Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software . Needed o. windows for Unix packages emulation.
  
* [Jupyter Installation ](https://jupyter.org/)

  - Jupyter Software support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages.
* [Git  Installation ](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of file.Used to maintain and update files in my Taskbook.
* [Cmdr  Installation  ](https://cmder.net/)
  - Cmder  is a command  Line Interface emualtor used on windows to emulate the UNIX shell.

## Task 1 

Created a jupyter journal with  a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.The notebook can be found in Task folder 1. [Task folder 1](https://github.com/OmalleyTomas98/EmergingTechnologiesTasks/blob/main/TASK1/squareRootProblem.ipynb)


## Task 2 

Created a jupyter journal with  a Python script to prove Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test like a t-test.With the use of the python class scipy.stats to verify this value and calculate the associated p value.The notebook can be found in [Task folder 2](https://github.com/OmalleyTomas98/EmergingTechnologiesTasks/blob/main/TASK2/chi-squaredTest.ipynb)

## Task 3 

Created a jupyter journal  with  a Python script to calculate the  two different versions of the standard deviation calculation, STDEV.P and  STDEV.S .The notebook can be found in [Task folder 3](https://github.com/OmalleyTomas98/EmergingTechnologiesTasks/blob/main/TASK3/standardDeviation.ipynb)
 

## Task 4 

Created a jupyter journal  with  a Python script that implements the  scikit-learn class to apply k-means clustering to Fisherâ€™s famous Iris data set.The notebook can be found in [Task folder 4](https://github.com/OmalleyTomas98/EmergingTechnologiesTasks/blob/main/TASK4/kmeansClustering.ipynb)
